# K_Means_Clustering
This program is a simple demonstration of the workings of the K-Means Clustering algorithm, which is an unsupervised learning method. Given un-labeled datapoints in 2-D, the algorithms attempts to categorize(cluster, classify) each data point based on their absolute distance to an initial center. This algorithm proves useful when we need to infer meaning from data which is available wihtout their classifying labels.
